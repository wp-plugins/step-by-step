== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Q. How do I get the steps on a page or post?
A. Once the steps are created and saved from the 'Guides' interface, a shortcode is automatically generated. This shortcode can be placed in a post or a page.

Q. Can I place photos in each step?
A. Yes.

Q. Does this work inside of the standard WYSIWYG interface?
A. Yes and No. The step-by-step admin interface called 'Guides' is separate from the standard WYSIWYG interface. Once guides containing steps have been created, the shortcode can be place anywhere you wish.
