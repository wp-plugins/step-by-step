== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Q. How do I get the steps on a page or post?  
A. Once the steps are created and saved from the 'Guides' interface, a shortcode is automatically generated. This shortcode can be placed in a post or a page.

Q. Can I place photos in each step?  
A. Yes.

Q. Does this work inside of the standard WYSIWYG interface?  
A. Yes and No. The step-by-step admin interface called 'Guides' is separate from the standard WYSIWYG interface. Once guides containing steps have been created, the shortcode can be place anywhere you wish.

Q. I did an update and now guide preview doesn’t work, what can I do?  
A. At this time guide previews may 404 for guides created using earlier versions. Guides created after a plugin update should preview fine.

Q. When I click view it shows a 404 error page.  
A. This appears to be a WordPress error and we have found two workarounds.  
  *Visit the "Permalink" page and then try to view your guide again.
  *Change your guide to "draft" instead of "published" and use the "preview" feature instead.
